Installation ThunderLab is available from PyPi . Simply run: pip install thunderlab If you have problems loading specific audio files with ThunderLab, then you need to install further packages. Follow the installation instructions of the AudioIO package. Software The ThunderLab package provides the following software: convertdata : Convert data from various file formats to audio files. multivariateexplorer : Simple GUI for viewing and exploring multivariate data. More Algorithms Click on the modules for more information. Input/output dataloader : Load time-series data from files. datawriter : Write time-series data to files. tabledata : Tables with hierarchical header including units and column-specific formats. Kind of similar to a pandas data frame, but without index column and with intuitive numpy-style indexing and nicely formatted output to csv, markdown, html, and latex. configfile : Configuration file with help texts for analysis parameter. consoleinput : User input from console. Basic data analysis eventdetection : Detect and handle peaks and troughs as well as threshold crossings in data arrays. powerspectrum : Compute and plot powerspectra and spectrograms for a given minimum frequency resolution. voronoi : Analyse Voronoi diagrams based on scipy.spatial. Used by thunderfish : Algorithms and programs for analysing electric field recordings of weakly electric fish. audian Python-based GUI for viewing and analyzing recordings of animal vocalizations.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#thunderlab","text":"Load and preprocess time series data.","title":"ThunderLab"},{"location":"#installation","text":"ThunderLab is available from PyPi .
